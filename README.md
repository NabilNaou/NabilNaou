# Nabil here, currently debugging life - and code.

I'm a developer based in the Netherlands, my exact title is Software Engineer. I spend most of my time working with Angular and TypeScript, occasionally with Laravel but only when Iâ€™m feeling brave.

Im fluent in English ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ and Dutch ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±, with some knowledge of German.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m into psychology, and jogging through Dutch weather. I read a lot of books at once and drink way too much tea.

### Things I use a lot:
- ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white), React, ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
- Laravel (Beginner), Java, C#, SQL
- Git, GitHub
- The usual HTML, CSS, JS.
- A healthy amount of console.log()
