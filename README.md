# Nabil here, currently debugging life - and code.

I'm a developer based in the Netherlands, my exact title is Software Engineer. I spend most of my time working with Angular and TypeScript, occasionally with Laravel but only when Iâ€™m feeling brave.

Im fluent in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, with some knowledge of German.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m into psychology, and jogging through Dutch weather. I read a lot of books at once and drink way too much tea.
